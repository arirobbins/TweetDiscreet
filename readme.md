**tweet box**

Once you click on the tweet Safe logo, you are taken to a simple form where you can begin to tweet.  When you are done, the counter will let you know if you have input to much text (more than 140 characters).  Next click evaluate, and tweet Safe will start to do its job!

**Analysis**

When the analysis is complete, a modal dialog will appear which will give you a break down of the sentiment of each of the sentences you types as well as the overall sentiment of the tweet.  From here you can decide whether to fix your tweet or to send it.
